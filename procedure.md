1. In block 1, click on drop-down button to select a particular value of α. 
2. Then click on the adjacent button to visualize the linear combination of the given element.
3. Proceed similarly with the remaining blocks to visualize the linear combination of two and three elements.
4. To visualize the linear combination of two elements, click on drop-down button to select particular values of α and β .
5. Then click on the adjacent button to see the result.
6. For three elements, click on the drop-down button to select particular values of α, β and  γ.
7. Then click on the adjacent button to see the result.
8. Click on the “Next” button to go to the next page.
9. Click on the “Pick a point (x)” button to see L(S), for S={x}.
10. Click on the “Pick a point (x)” button in the next block.
11. Then click on the “Pick another point (y)” button. Now click on the “on line” button or “not on line” button to see L(S), where S={x, y}. Repeat for the other case.
12. Same exercise is to be repeated in the third block to visualize the span of multiple points.
